### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned that using Ajax allows your webpage to operate quite quickly because it allows client webpages to interact with a web server without having to reload the entire page.
2. I learned that the Google Search engine was one of the first commercial uses of Ajax.
3. I learned that JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a subset of JavaScript, not its own language.
